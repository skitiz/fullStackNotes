# SQL and PL/SQL

## Joins
1. Inner Join.
2. Left and Right Joins
3. Full Join


## Business Logic of SQL
_PLC_: Procedural Languages. Basically avoids a lot of transactions to the database.
1. Anonymous blocks : are not resuable.
2. Named blocks : are resuable a.k.a procedures.

_Procedure:_ Any kind of business logic. `Procedure` may or may not return a value, whereas `function` __has__ to return a value.

__Mandatory Keywords__ : _Begin, Declare, End_.

`Set Server Output (on)`

`Sequence` : Auto population of column values. You have to write a trigger for it.

`Cursors`: Pointer to the context area.
1. Implicit Cursors : _DML_ commands
2. Explicit Cursors :

_Side Mote_ : `DISTINCT` values.
_Side Note_ : Variables in PL/SQL and SQL.
